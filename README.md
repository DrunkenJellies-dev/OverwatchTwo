# Overwatch 2 Lore Hub

## Purpose

This Project is a static website that focuses on the description of the complex lore for the video game release by Blizzard Activision Overwatch 2. It aims to de clutter all of teh information out there that surrounds the story of this video game and put it all in one place for people to see. It provides users with a detailed timeline on all of the events that take place during the story of the aforementioned video game while it's presented in a nice and clean manner making it more digestible for users to understand. 

This is the core purpose of this project, I feel that there was a problem when it came to learning the story behind this video game that you can't find out without scouring all corners of the internet so naturally I believe that this could be solved by bringing all of the information together into one place that that is clear concise and easily understandable.

This website was built using HTML and CSS as a Milestone Project#1 for the Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development Course.

**Typography**

* Oswald was chosen as it's a bold attention grabbing font that looks and feels modern and professional. I also like how condensed the letter look as for the logo I wanted it to look nice and compact. In addition, Oswald also maintains excellent readability even at larger sizes making it a versatile choice for creating a bold a visual identity.

* Lato was chosen for use in paragraphs or long strings of text as it is a highly legible font making it an excellent choice for the main text of a website.

**Images**

* The Images in this project come from various sources as there is an abundance trailers and promotional content created by the video game company and even more edited by fans of the game which still have a very high quality. 

# Features

**Navigaton Bar**

* The Navigation bar is shown on every page with a logo on the left side when clicked the user is always taken back to the HomePage. This practise is used on the vast majority of webpages so that the user is already accustomed to this practise; this helps with familiarity on the website.

* The Navigation bar to the other webpages are displayed on the right of the screen each with a link to the pages that share the same name. These would be Home, Timeline and Signup.

**Introduction Section**

* The Introduction section is shown right after the hero image on the homepage so that users can delve deeper into what to expect from the site and find out more.

* It encourages the user to keep exploring the site once they find out if they are intersted or not

**Description Section**

* This section is used to show the user all of the different topics that are covered on the website by giving different snippets on each on respectiely. This will help gather intrigue and encourage the user to go out and look for the information that they want to find on the site.

**'Meet The Heroes' Image Carousel**

* This is a graphic that allows the user to cycle through all of the different characters to expect to find out more about on the website. I think this would also keep up user retention rate as it allows the user to iteract with the site directly alongside seeing some of their favourite heroes.

**Map Youtube Trailer**

* This is an embeded video which shows a trailer of one of the most historic maps within the video game. This allows users to interact with the site more while also getting a glimpse of what some more of the topics are going to be discussed.

**Footer**

* The footer, just like the navigation bar, is shown on all pages on the website; The consistency of the design allows for a better user expeience as they gain a familiarity towards the website. It includes 5 links to social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and Steam. 

* These links will open in new tabs so that the user doesn't have to leave the website to view the content.

* The footer also includes a small navigation bar for so that when users scroll down they are drawn to that section and encouraged to continue exploreing the site.

**Timeline Page**

* The timeline page includes a complete list of a series of events that allow the user to see everything that has happened in the story up until the present day. This is the main attraction of the site as the purpose was to be able to layout all of the story in a clear , understandable, and attractive manner.
